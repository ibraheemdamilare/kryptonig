           <h2>The Benefits of DAOs to Web3 Projects, Creators, and Communities</h2>
           <h3>Introduction</h3>
           <p>
           Blockchain Technology ushered in an era of technological development built on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and Trust. These principles laid the foundation for other emerging infrastructures that aim to reduce the overconcentration of powers in the hands of a few, provide a trustless system of governance, and ensure transparency of organizational processes and transactions. One of these infrastructures is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
  <br /> The concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) has recently been a popular subject of discussion in Web3 Space. From the quest to understand how these organizations truly function, to the need to understand their merits and demerits.
  <br /> A DAO is an emerging Web3 organizational structure with no central authority or governing body. DAOs provide mechanisms for decision-making in blockchain technology where participating members vote to decide on changes to the underlying protocol or to make investment and financial decisions. To learn more about the meaning of DAOs and how they function, read our previous article on Understanding the DAO Model in Web3.
        <br /> Meanwhile, in this article, we aim to explain the benefits of DAOs to Web3 projects, creators, collectors, and communities; and why you should care about this emerging Organizational structure.

           <h3>Key Take Away</h3>
           <p>
           DAOs are decentralized organizations with no central authority
           <br /> Governance rights of a DAO are evenly distributed among all members
               <br />  Benefits of DAOs include decentralization, autonomy, transparency, access to larger funding, trust, ease of access and collaboration, community building, community governance, and promotion of charitable courses.
<br /> Despite these benefits, there are still challenges facing DAOs. These challenges include Security challenges, delays in decision-making, and legal issues.

             <h2>
                 Benefits Of DAO
             </h2>
             <ol>
                 <li>
                 <span>Decentralization:</span> This is one of the core tenets of DAOs. DAOs prevent the concentration of decision-making powers in the hands of a central authority or a few individuals. Instead, governance and decision-making powers are distributed to all members of the Organization who vote to decide the direction and actions of such organizations. With this decentralized nature, the Organizations will be immune from the Whims of a few managers or directors who wield enormous powers as in traditional institutions.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Autonomy:</span> DAOs are autonomous. The smart contracts on which DAOs are based are pre-coded rules that automatically execute when a particular condition is met. Smart contracts can handle transactions automatically thereby eliminating human error in transactions. 
                 </li>
                 <li>
                <span> Transparency:</span> DAOs run on Blockchain technology. Hence, all transactions and votes happen on the blockchain, making them publicly viewable. In essence, every member of a DAO can confirm that the actions are implemented as decided by the voting process; and that all transactions are made in line with the decision of the DAO.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Ease of Access and Collaboration: </span>DAOs are available to every eligible member from all parts of the World. Hence, people of diverse backgrounds and nationalities can easily collaborate to invest and govern multi-billion dollar organizations. However, to qualify for admission into a DAO, an applicant may be required to acquire a certain amount of the Organization’s native token or contribute funds (in cryptocurrencies) to the DAO Liquidity Pool.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Eliminates Manipulation of Funds by a few individuals:</span> DAO powers are not concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. Therefore, the manipulation of funds by the privileged few is eliminated. This is because there is even no such thing as a privileged few in a DAO since governance and voting powers are distributed among all members. Again, every transaction done in a DAO is recorded on a blockchain, which is immutable and public. Hence, members can verify that every transaction was done for the purpose that it was meant for.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Trust:</span> Because the smart contracts on which DAOs are based live on the Blockchain, and because a DAO’s entire decision-making process is automated, there is complete trust in the system. Members can trust the codes which are accessible to them and can be audited to ensure security. Importantly, The Smart contract of a DAO cannot be modified unless such modification is agreed upon by members of the DAO. If anyone tries to modify the smart contract without following due process, such modifications will fail.
                 </li>
                 <li><span>Access to Larger Funding: </span>Through DAO Liquidity pools, Web3 projects and creators can gain access to larger funding to grow their projects. Again, investors can pull funds together to invest in capital-intensive projects or to buy assets that the members of the pool won’t be able to afford individually. This could be important for collectors who wish to own a fragment of a rare expensive NFT. To achieve this, Collectors can set up what is known as Collector DAOs to pool funds together to acquire rare NFTs. Kryptonig’s DAO Liquidity pool is a good example of a DAO where participants can pool funds together to invest in viable Web3 projects or to acquire rare assets.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Community Building: </span>The success of any Web3 project depends, to an extent, on how the community adopts such a project. To increase the chances of success, members of a DAO can build a community around projects that they invest in. For instance, participants can create a buzz around projects in a Collector DAO where members pool funds to acquire rare NFTs or NFT Projects.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>Community Governance Tools:</span> DAOs can also be set up to decide how the underlying protocols of Web3 projects are managed. In this case, native tokens of such organizations are acquired by members for such members to vote and participate in general decision-making concerning the organization and its protocol. A good example is Maker DAO which decides on changes to the Maker protocol.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <span>DAOs can encourage Charity: </span>The automated nature of DAOs and the fact that they are built on a blockchain removes the ability of humans to manipulate or misappropriate funds. It also ensures that the movement of funds is publicly viewable on the Blockchain, making the whole process transparent. Hence, donors and other benefactors will be able to verify the utilization of the funds on the blockchain. This can encourage more donors to join charity DAOs to provide for people in need.
                 </li>
             </ol>
             <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
             <p>
             While we have explained some of the benefits of DAOs in this article, it is important to note that there are still concerns about the nature and legality of DAOs. Some of the challenges facing DAOs include delays in decision-making, security challenges, and legal issues.
                <br /> If you are looking for an exciting DAO project to join, Kryptonig’s DAO Liquidity Pool is surely a project to watch out for. The Pool gives participants (investors, users) the freedom to vote, choose, and co-invest in projects through a mutual fund. The pool will enable participants to invest in high-stake projects including NFT projects, in which individual members of the pool wouldn’t have been financially sufficient to invest on their own.
