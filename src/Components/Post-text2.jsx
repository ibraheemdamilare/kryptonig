            <h3>Understanding the DAO Model in Web3</h3>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>The Concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) has been growing in popularity and usage within the Web3 space. You probably heard of CityDAO that acquired 40 acres of land in Wyoming in November 2021; or the Constitution DAO that tried, but failed to buy a copy of the American Constitution after raising $47 million in 72 hours. These entities have no hierarchy, and no Board of Directors; yet they make visible investments. So what exactly are DAOs? This question is what this article aims to answer.</p>
            <h5>What is a DAO ?</h5>
            <p>DAO is the acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. A DAO is an emerging Web3 organizational structure with no central authority or governing body. The entity is collectively owned and managed by all members who share similar goals and act in the best interest of the organization. DAOs provide mechanisms for decision-making in blockchain technology where participating members vote to decide on changes to the underlying protocol or to make investment and financial decisions. 
               <br /> Interestingly, rules guiding a DAO are enforced on the blockchain using a smart contract. Hence, all votes and activities of a DAO are recorded on the blockchain, making them public, transparent, and immutable.
               <br /> Unlike traditional corporate organizations, DAOs are flat without hierarchy. Although the weight of votes may be different depending on the number of tokens held or the amount of funds contributed by each member. DAOs are becoming increasingly important and popular in the Web3 
               space, attracting a significant volume of investments. In fact, as of November 2022, over $11 billion had been invested in DAOs.</p>


            <h2>The Story behind the Origin of DAOs</h2>
            <p>The idea of Decentralized  Autonomous Organizations came up in 2016 by a group of developers who conceptualized a decentralized form of managing organizations and their funds in a way where there is no central authority, but every member taking decisions to ensure progress.</p>
            <p>Now think about a public company, for instance - there is a Board of Directors that makes crucial decisions such as hiring and firing CEOs, approving budgets, etc. The Board is a central authority governing such public entities. This is the opposite of a DAO model. In a DAO, there is no central authority but every member partakes in decision-making.
                <br /> One of the earliest known DAOs was named ‘the DAO’. It was an organization created to automate decisions and facilitate crypto transactions. However, it suffered malicious attacks which led to loss of funds and the eventual fall of the Organization.
            </p>
            <h2>How DAOs works ?</h2>
            <p>DAOs are built around smart contracts. Smart contracts are codes that execute an agreement once a pre-defined condition is met. For instance, a smart contract may be written to transfer a particular amount of cryptocurrencies to a specified wallet address once the sender and receiver sign the transaction. Hence in a DAO, smart contracts are often written to achieve the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>to set up the DAO</li>
                <li>to implement changes to the underlying protocol of the DAO </li>
                <li>to execute investment decisions</li>
                <li>to increase the number of tokens in circulation or </li>
                <li>to burn a particular amount of tokens</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Basically, smart contracts establish the rules of a DAO. Once the smart contract of a DAO is fully developed and audited, and the required funding is completed, the DAO gets deployed to a blockchain. After deployment, no changes or modifications can be effected to the protocol or the code base unless such changes are decided by members of the DAO through a voting process.
              <br /> The votes in a DAO are recorded on the blockchain. Members of a DAO often vote to decide on investment options for the organization. DAOs usually have a common treasury where the funds pooled by members are stored. Hence, members can vote on decisions like whether or not to purchase a particular NFT or invest in a particular project of interest using funds from the common treasury. In other words, participants of a DAO majorly vote for treasury allocations and technical upgrades.
                <br /> The number of times each member can vote or the weight of the votes cast by each member generally depends on the number of native tokens held by individual members or the amount of funds contributed by each member. Again, token-holding and share-holding in a DAO depend on the admission procedures laid down by the DAO in question. 
            </p>

            <p>Generally, a participant can be admitted into a DAO through any of the following ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>	One can be admitted into a DAO if they hold a minimum specified number of the DAOs native token. </li>
                <li>	A prospective member can contribute funds (in crypto) to a DAO liquidity pool in other to participate in governance and decision-making</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For DAOs that admit members for holding tokens, the weight of the votes allocated to each member depends on the number of tokens they hold. For instance, the votes of a member who holds 10, 000 tokens will be double the weight of the votes of another member who holds 5,000 tokens. Despite this disparity in the weight of votes, the voting powers in a DAO are evenly distributed to avoid the concentration of power in the hands of a few individual members. However, for DAOs that admit members for pooling equal amounts of funds together, the weight of votes is distributed equally.</p>
            <p>Decisions on proposals are made and approved once the majority of members vote in favour of such proposals. The nature of this majority (whether a simple majority or otherwise) varies from DAO to DAO, but the majority determinant must be coded into the smart contract.</p>

            <h3>Membership of a DAO</h3>
            <p>There are two major ways to gain membership or voting/governance rights in a DAO. They include the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><span>Token-based Membership:</span> Where members are admitted for possessing a stipulated minimum quantity of the Organization’s native token. For example, MakerDAO requires ownership of the MKR token to participate in voting.</li>
                <li><span>Share-based Membership:</span> In share-based membership, participants are admitted for contributing a particular amount of funds (in crypto) to the DAO pool. The admission process generally requires prospective members to submit a proposal. This is the type of membership that Kryptonig’s DAO Liquidity Pool is built on.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Benefits of DAOs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> <span>Decentralization:</span> Just as the name implies, there is no central authority in decentralized autonomous organizations. The decision is made by every member of the DAO. Hence, the power to take decisions cannot be concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. This prevents abuse of power</li>
                <li> <span>Trustless System: </span> Participants in a DAO do not need to bother about trust. They only need to verify and trust the codes, which are also open-source and publicly available.</li>
                <li><span>Transparency:</span> Votes cast in a DAO or general decisions made by a DAO are recorded on the blockchain making them publicly viewable and immutable for future reference. Also, all transactions emanating from a DAO are done on the blockchain. Hence, anyone can check to ensure that the funds are used for exactly the purposes they were meant for. Even smart contracts upon which the DAOs run are open-sourced and public.</li>
                <li><span>Seamless Collaboration: </span> a DAO enables people from all over the world to pool funds together and pursue a common course. Members of a DAO do not need to know one another. In fact, participants mainly represent themselves with pseudonyms and avatars. However, the decentralized nature of the system ensures that everyone can collaborate and decide on issues of importance to the entity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Weaknesses of a DAO</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The voting period may take time since everyone is given the opportunity to vote. This situation can delay decision-making and impede the efficiency of DAOs.</li>
                <li>Varying national and educational backgrounds of members of a DAO may impact the capacity of some members to interpret and understand issues at hand, thereby affecting the quality of decisions being made.</li>
                <li>Just like other Web3 infrastructure, security breaches are still common and may lead to loss of trust, or even loss of funds. </li>
                <li>Legal Issues: As with other blockchain technologies, legal regulations on DAOs remain vague. Hence activities of DAOs may be deemed to violate some securities and exchange regulations. For example, In July 2017, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission claimed that The DAO sold securities in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain without authorization. The SEC further stated that such sales violated portions of securities law in America.</li>
                <li>DAOs are largely new entities. This means that a lot of people who are not exposed to blockchain technology may not be carried along. Again, those who wish to participate may require more education on the concept of DAOs before they can fully understand its rudiments. However, this is where platforms like Kryptonig’s Community forum come in to help with this education.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Use Cases of a DAO</h2>
            <p>A DAO can be used in the following scenarios:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                <span>Venture/Investment DAOs:</span> Members of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization can pool funds together via Liquidity Pools to invest in viable Web3 projects, purchase physical assets, or purchase rare NFTs.
                </li>
                <li><span>Governance DAOs:</span> DAOs can be formed to decide on changes to the protocol of a Blockchain-based entity. For example, MakerDAO - a protocol used to facilitate peer-to-peer borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies.</li>
                <li><span>Grant DAOs:</span> As the name implies, these DAOs are specifically formed to provide grants to projects of interest.</li>
                <li>Charity Organizations can also form a DAO where members pool funds together and vote for donations to charitable courses. A good example is the Ukraine DAO formed to pool support for victims of War in the country.</li>
                <li>Freelancer networks can also pool funds together using a DAO model for software subscription.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Examples of DAOs</h3>
            <p>Some of the Notable Decentralized Autonomous Organizations include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                  <span>Uniswap:</span> In Uniswap, DAO members generally vote on the distribution of fees collected by the protocol. Uniswap launched its governance token in September 2020 and became a full-fledged DAO.
                </li>
                <li>
                	<span>SharkDAO:</span> SharkDAO was established to facilitate the pooling of funds by individual token holders to acquire rare and expensive NFTs which would have been too expensive and risky for individual members to purchase on their own.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>MakerDAO: </span>Maker DAO members mainly vote on changes to the maker protocol. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>BitDAO:</span>BitDAO dedicates funds to the growth of DeFI projects. It has a native token, BIT, which acts as its governance token. BIT holders can submit proposals and vote on proposals put forward by other members.
                </li>
                <li>
                 <span>CurveDAO:</span>  This is an exchange liquidity pool hosted in the Ethereum network. Curve DAO offers liquidity-based funds to Web3 projects worldwide.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How to get into a DAO</h3>
            <p>
            It is important to note that all DAOs do not have the same purpose or mode of operation. So, you have to study the DAOs and understand their purpose and mode of operation before deciding to join.
  <br /> If it’s a DAO that requires you to hold a particular amount of their native token to participate in their pools, then you purchase the tokens to qualify. However, if the DAO requires you to contribute a particular amount of funds to participate, you do that. Generally, this later procedure requires prospective members to submit a proposal for admission.
  <br /> If you are looking for an exciting DAO project to join, Kryptonig’s DAO Liquidity Pool is surely a project to watch out for. The Pool gives participants (investors, users) the freedom to vote, choose, and co-invest in projects through a mutual fund. The pool will enable participants to invest in high-stake projects including NFT projects, in which individual members of the pool wouldn’t have been financially sufficient to invest on their own.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The concept of DAO is still in its infancy, which means there are still rooms for experimentation, trials, and improvements to mitigate the shortcomings of the model. However, DAOs have come to stay. And we are bullish on its great prospects in the near and long-term future. Importantly, Kryptonig aims to contribute to the growth of the sector.</p>
