                <h3>Alternative Paths in crypto</h3>
                <p>Consider an Olympic village preparing for an Olympics games which has the following features:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Olympic village itself where the structures are built</li>
                    <li>The structures — stadiums, tracks, fields, hotels, eateries, roads</li>
                    <li>The engineers who build these structures</li>
                    <li>Teams and athletes participating in the Olympic Games</li>
                    <li>Managers/coaches of the Teams and Athletes</li>
                    <li>Media teams and journalists who cover the games</li>
                    <li>Public Relations Officers of the participating teams</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Just as the Olympic village is made up of these roles, so is the crypto world made up of diverse roles which form a whole force that keeps the industry growing. These diverse roles are filled with individuals who possess different skill sets and experiences. Let’s relate the various components of the Olympic village to some of the career paths in crypto.</p>

                <h3>1. Blockchain/Web3 Development: </h3>
                <p>Blockchain/web3 development is one of the most popular entry-level crypto jobs. While the blockchain/crypto industry is like the Olympic village, the blockchains (ethereum, flow, Solana, and others) upon which applications are built are likened to the stadiums, tracks, and other structures on which the game actions take place. Developers are like the engineers who build the structures. In this case, developers build applications such as Decentralized Applications (dApps), Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), crypto tokens, Metaverse platforms, NFT minting platforms, NFT marketplaces, and NFT Galleries on top of blockchain platforms.
                    Blockchain/web3 developers are highly sought. The average annual salary of blockchain/web3 developers is $100k/year
                    To become a blockchain developer, a candidate should have pre-requisite knowledge of working with object-oriented languages such as Python, Javascript, and Java. Interested persons must also be able to work with high-level programming languages like solidity and be able to build applications with blockchain APIs and frameworks like truffle and Hardhat.
